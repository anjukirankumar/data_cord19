      "text": "The world was made aware of a newly discovered coronavirus via an email from Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki, an Egyptian virologist working at the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The email was published on the website of the professional emerging diseases (ProMED) network on 20- September-2014 (ProMED, 2014 . That first case was a 60 year old man from Bisha in the KSA and, thanks to the email, the rapid discovery of a second case of the virus, this time in an ill patient from Qatar, was transferred to the United Kingdom for care ( Fig. 1) (Bermingham et al., 2012) . As of 20th January 2015, there have been 969 detections of viral RNA or virus-specific antibodies reported publicly, 955 confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with over a third of the positive people dying (n = 351, 37%; data from public sources including the WHO and Ministries of Health). First known as novel coronavirus (nCoV), the following two to three years were a slow discovery process revealing a virus that appears well established among dromedary camels (DC; Camelus dromedarius) across the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa. From infected DCs, the virus is thought to infrequently infect exposed humans. Concern was raised early on that patenting of the first viral isolate would lead to restricted access to the virus and to viral diagnostics (Sciencemag, 2014) . However, sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics were available (Abdel-Moneim, 2014) almost immediately. Virus was also made freely available subject to routine biosafety considerations, supporting many of the research findings described herein. In search of an animal host, bats were implicated in August 2013 but in that same month a DC link was reported (Reusken et al., 2013c) and that link has matured into a verifiable association. In humans, overt disease was finally given the name Middle East respiratory syndrome and the acronym MERS. From these animal-to-human spillover events, the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV; see Section 3 for variation in naming) spread sporadically among people, causing more severe disease among older males with underlying diseases. The proportion of infected people who are confirmed to have died from MERS-CoV infection is much higher than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, influenza virus or many other pathogens. The spread of MERS-CoV among humans has often been associated with outbreaks in hospitals, which in 2012-2014 usually commenced in March (Mackay, 2014; Maltezou and Tsiodras, 2014) . This spread may be linked to some seasonal environmental changes, change in host animal behaviour, or perhaps simple coincidence between season and successive hospital outbreaks. Approximately a fifth of all cases to date have involved healthcare workers (HCWs), spiking alongside periods of increased total case numbers. Social media, blogs and the mainstream media have kept close tabs on the spread of MERS-CoV to 23 countries in Europe, Asia and the United States of America (USA; Fig. 2 ), mostly with an origin in the KSA from where 88% of viral detections have occurred. Twitter in particular has provided a global forum through specific hashtags like #MERS and the Arabic hashtag #AF4FD? or #Coruna. An engaged world has helped understand how the virus has affected the KSA and its neighbouring countries and allowed outsiders to view science musings take shape, collaborations form, local news and commentary trend and new results be discussed in real time. Social media provides new avenues for scientists to express experienced opinion, to more widely communicate their research and to engage with public health entities, the public themselves and the mainstream media. This degree of engagement was not possible in 2002/2003 when the SARS global outbreak began its rise to 8100 human cases including 770 deaths (proportion of fatal cases, or PFC, of 9.5%). The ubiquity of social media appears to have changed what the public expects from a State when it communicates about new or existing infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics, and how quickly they expect that to occur.",

      "text": "Patients with MERS often present themselves to a hospital with systemic and lower respiratory tract (LRT) signs and symptoms of disease which usually include fever, chills or rigors, dry or productive cough, shortness of breath (dyspnea) and one or more comorbidities including diabetes (prevalent in the KSA), chronic kidney disease including renal failure, chronic heart disease and heart failure, recent surgery, hypertension, chronic lung disease, asthma, obesity, smoking, malignant disease or steroid use (Arabi et al., 2014; Assiri et al., 2013a; Hijawi et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . MERS-CoV may be identified in patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction which can precede death in over a third of infections (Arabi et al., 2014; Assiri et al., 2013a; Hijawi et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . Extrapulmonary disease manifestations include circulatory, renal, hepatic and hematologic dysfunction. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been seen in 20-33% of cases (Assiri et al., 2013a; Mailles et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013b; Zumla and Memish, 2014) , manifesting as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not seen at all in one family cluster (Omrani et al., 2013) nor among symptomatic children in another . On occasion, fever and gastrointestinal upset may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline to be are later followed by more severe systemic and respiratory signs and symptoms (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014; Mailles et al., 2013) . Rarely, MERS-CoV has been detected in a person with fever but no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms . The extent to which infection by other gastrointestinal pathogens affect this variability is unknown.",

      "text": "However, while MERS-CoV is not a rapidly spreading global contagion, it may evolve further to become that or another may emerge in the future and vigilance and rapid communication will be key to a timely response and early containment. Every time a new virus emerges, we learn more, requiring us to re-examine what we previously \"knew\". One constant in all this however is the human; it is we who fan the flames of a disease cluster until it becomes an outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. Viruses do not emerge and gain a foothold without our aid, or our lapses in vigilance. MERS highlighted that some paradigms can be stumbling blocks to seeking and communicating knowledge and containing and understanding the spread and nature of a virus. It also served as yet another reminder to us that global human and animal health, politics, agriculture and economies are all intimately interwoven and it takes just a single tiny virus to tip a very fine balance.",
