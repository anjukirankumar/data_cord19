      "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis is a multisystemic disease of domestic and exotic cats caused by a coronavirus. An outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis was investigated in a closed colony of European wildcats (Fells silvestris) at a zoological garden. Over a six-year period, a putative fading kitten syndrome occurred in six of 11 litters born and severe lesions of infectious peritonitis occurred in five of the eight wildcats retained in the colony during this period. Lesions were more acute in the early stages of the outbreak and included perivascular pyogranulomatons inflammation with exudative serositis. Lesions occurred only in males. Vascular lesions were common in the liver of all affected wildcats, serositis occurred in the abdominal and thoracic cavities in most cases and meningeal lesions were present in two cases. Immunohistochemistry with specific antisera detected viral antigen within macrophages in all lesions. This outbreak demonstrates that the lesions of feline infectious peritonitis can become modified over time and that the virus can persist in a closed colony, possibly via carrier wildcats.",

      "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae and is a single stranded RNA virus with three major structural proteins, including a nucleocapsid protein (Lai, 1990) . Studies on the pathogenesis of FIPV in both domestic and exotic cats have demonstrated that an acute, fulminant disease (so-called \"wet\" or \"effusive\" FIP) can occur on challenge of seropositive cats as compared with a milder response (so-called \"dry\" or \"non-effusive\" FIP) in seronegative cats (for a review see Pedersen, 1983) . It is believed that the presence of pre-existing antibody leads to either immune complex deposition (Jacobese-Geels, Daha and Horzinek, 1982) or antibodydependent enhancement of macrophage infection upon challenge by FIPV (Olsen, Corapi, Ngichabe, Baines and Scott, 1992) . Therefore, naturally and experimentally ini~cted domestic cats develop lesions with a marked variation in intensity, depending on the cat's antibody status.",

Similar lesions have been reported in a number of exotic cats kept in zoological gardens (Colly, 1973) ; however, they have not been previously reported in the European wildcat. A serological survey of freeliving European wildcats in Great Britain did not detect any animals seropositive for FIPV (McOrist, Bold, Jones, Easterbee, Hubbard and Jarrett, 1991) . This study provided an opportunity to examine the pathological and epidemiological features of naturally occurring infectious peritonitis in a closed colony of European wildcats.",

In this study lesions due to hepatocyte infection were the earliest changes detectable in the liver, with syncytium formation and necrosis. These lesions were analogous to those caused by another coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (Blackmore, Guillon and Schwanzer, 1981) . Macrophages in the liver of the wildcats, including Kupffer cells, were also infected with the virus. As virus is rarely found free in the blood a cell-borne transmission to the hepatocyte is likely, probably via the Kupffer cells. The frequency of infection ofnon-macrophage cells in other organs is not known but was not common in this study.",
